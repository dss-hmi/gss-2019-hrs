# Reasons for starting and stopping medications for opioid use disorder: a qualitative analysis

**Background**: Despite their efficacy, medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are underutilized in the United States. Few studies have explored reasons why individuals pick MOUD versus non-MOUD options or why people discontinue using MOUD once they start. We sought to identify reasons why individuals start MOUD and stop MOUD, including how they learn of MOUD options. We also explored differences between starting and stopping the three most common formulations: methadone, oral buprenorphine, and extended-release naltrexone.

**Methods**: We conducted 31 semi-structured interviews over the phone with individuals with a history of MOUD utilization and one parent of an individual with a history of MOUD utilization who passed away. Participants were recruited using snowball sampling from nine U.S. states. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded in DedooseÂ© software, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

**Results**: Participants primarily learned about buprenorphine and methadone from other individuals with OUD. Reasons for starting MOUD versus non-MOUD options varied significantly by medication and included perception of its efficacy in preventing relapse in peers (buprenorphine and methadone), exhaustion of other treatment options (methadone only), and perception of its efficacy in preventing overdose or death if relapse occurs (buprenorphine only). Across all three medications, participants stopped MOUD due to the desire to stop physical dependency (i.e. stop taking daily medication, doctor visits, etc.). Participants utilizing buprenorphine and methadone treatment felt pressure from various sources to quit their medications. 

**Conclusion**: This study underscores the crucial role of peer-to-peer education regarding MOUD. We recommend that more peer support specialists with MOUD experience be incorporated into formal SUD treatment. Education initiatives, especially through peer-to-peer storytelling, should address misconceptions about MOUD.

# Reducing health care costs and improving health outcomes: Is patient-centered care the means to achieve the incongruent objectives?

_Stephen Mhere, Barbara Andraka-Christou_

**Purpose**: This research determines if primary care physicians use patient-centered care and whether healthcare policies predicated on the practice can be effective in achieving cost reductions while improving health outcomes. 

**Methods**: Primary care physicians were surveyed through self-administered questionnaires and a hypothesis based on proportions was developed to test their patient-centeredness. Physicians were deemed to be patient-centered if they had adopted at least five of nine attributes. Hypothesis testing was used to determine patient-centeredness. Deductive reasoning was applied to reach conclusions regarding the likely efficacy of patient-centered care (PCC) policies in reducing costs and improving health outcomes. 

**Results**: Survey participation rate was 39.5%. Adoption rates for individual patient-centered care attributes ranged from 88.2% for electronic health record (EHR) adoption to 0.0% for patient portal implementation. Overall patient-centered care adoption rate was about 65%.

**Conclusion**: Primary care physicians use patient-centered care. Therefore adopting patient-centered care policies to enable reductions in healthcare spending cuts and improvements in health outcomes is unlikely to be effective. However, results show low adoption rates for some of the patient-centered attributes, providing possibilities for improvement. This study has significant internal and external validity issues, warranting further studies before concrete healthcare policies predicated on patient-centered care are adopted.
